# paint_project_js

A basic web redition of the paint app we know and love. 

This app allows the user to save and load up the masterpieces whenever they like. 

## Motivation
This was a project that was created to fufill curriculum requirements for the Flatiron JS project assessment. I selected the task of setting up a rudimentary paint app to showcase skills, like canvas manipulation and mouse positioning, that I had been learing outside of my curriculum instruction.

## Tech/framworks used
* JavaScript (used for app's front end)
* Ruby on Rails (used to build backend api)
